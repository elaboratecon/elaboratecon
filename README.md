## Hi there, my name is Jason ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full stack software engineer living in Los Angeles, CA.

I'm also going to college at Oregon State University (eCampus) for a degree in Computer Science.

My go-to language is JavaScript, as I specialize in frontend. I love React, Next.js, SCSS, and frontend build tools. I'm also decent at Python, use Django a lot, and know my SQL and No-SQL databases.
